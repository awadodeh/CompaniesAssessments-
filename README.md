1.       Given a string, write a function or method that takes in that string, and returns the same string in reverse order.
 
·        Example: Given the string “Hello”, your program would return “olleH”
·        Do not assume that “Hello” is the only string it will handle
 
2.       Given a string, return the character count for each distinct character in the string.
 
·        Example: "abacca" -> a: 3, b: 1, c: 2
·        Once again, do not assume that “abacca” is the only string it will handle
